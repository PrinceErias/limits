A list of clear limits and boundaries. Do NOT push them, you will be blocked, and I will cut you out, no matter how brutal or blunt I need to be. I do not give a shit anymore.
Respect my fucking boundaries.
These are subject to change. If you cannot keep up, that is not my problem. Fuck you.

  If I tell you to stop something, I have a reason. I do not need to give you a reason. Again, fuck you.
  Do not push me. Ever. If I say no, it means no. If I say 'Stop, I do not like this topic,' it means stop. And do not tell me you did not realize that's what I meant. I don't care, I never will.
  Don't fuck with me. Take that how you will.
  Curiosity killed the cat. Your curiosity of what happens when you push these boundaries killed you. Or, at least, our friendship. Whatever we had, that will be the end of it.
  There are a few exceptions to these. Do not ask me if you are one of them. If I have not made it clear that you are, then you are not.
  Use common sense. If you have a boudary, I have it to.
  Don't ask me twice. When I say I heard you, that is that. If it is important to you, Great! It's porabably not important to me. And if you see that as YOU are not important to me, you probably aren't.
  You are not special (Unless I like you.).
  There are four or five people in this universe I give a shit about. No, I will not tell you if you are one of them. Act like you aren't.
  If you think I care about you - I probably don't. 

  Pretty much, you get 3 warnings. First warning, Verbal. Second warning, I block you until.. Well, until I feel like it. Third warning, bye. That's it.
