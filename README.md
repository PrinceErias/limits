A list of clear limits and boundaries. Do NOT push them, you will be blocked, and I will cut you out, no matter how brutal or blunt I need to be. I do not give a shit anymore.
Respect my fucking boundaries.
These are subject to change. If you cannot keep up, that is not my problem. Fuck you.


  When I say stop, I mean it. Fuck you, I don't need to explain myself.
  Never push me. No is no. I do not care if you recognize that is what I meant. I do not care, and never will.
  Don't ask twice. If I say I heard you, I heard you.  If the topic is important to you, Great! It's probably not important to me. If you see that as YOU are not important to me, you probably are not.
  Do not expect me to change how I act to accommodate your stupidity. Your intelligence level, or lack thereof, is not my problem.
  Do not be actively homophobic, transphobic or anything under those umbrellas. I don't require your support, but do not actively push us down.

Oh, and remember: I do not need to explain myself to you, or to anyone.
Pretty much, you get 3 warnings. First warning, Verbal. Second warning, I block you until.. Well, until I feel like it. Third warning, bye. That's it.
